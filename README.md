# FCC_sms_text_classification
Coding project from Machine Learning with Python course at freecodecamp.org

Classification of sms texts as "ham" or "spam" with a RNN. A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.
Text classification with an RNN (https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_classification_rnn) was a great help to complete this project.
